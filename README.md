File: factor_model_analysis.ipynb

Description: This project analyzes a constantly changing 700+ equities universe through the lens of fundamental factor signals.

Notes: project done as part of Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Strategies course at NYU Courant


## 2. Robust Covariance Portfolio Selection

File: kernelPCA_covariance_filtering.ipynb

Description: This project implements Kernel PCA & Matrix Filtering in the construction of the covariance matrix of asset returns computed from in-sample data, conducts mean-variance optimization with the obtained matrix and compares out-of-sample portfolio performance with other methods of covariance construction for the NASDAQ 100, FTSE 100, CAC 40, and DAX universes.
